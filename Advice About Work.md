# Advice About Work
This is my personal advice. I'm a bit of a noob to the games industry, so I can't be confident this advice is any good, but I am atleast adding some options out there for what you might potentially want to do.

## Working for a Game Studio
Lot's of jobs across Europe:

A typical weedkly email looks like this: https://mailchi.mp/gamesjobsdirect/looking-for-your-next-job-in-video-games-94745?e=1d46ce4060

Surpising good but probably more likely to see general computing job listings and fewer game dev: https://careers.southwales.ac.uk/

## Indie Game Dev
### Make Like-minded Friends
If there's a game you like from a small or independent studio, consider reaching out to them (why not?). Let them know you like their game and get their contact details (LinkedIn, X). If you have a portfolio, they might check it out...

Start small too. The GameDevCardiff group meets every couple of weeks at The Owain Glyndwr pub in Cardiff Centre (sorry I can't remeber when this happens) and anyone is welcome. They have a Discord if you want to chat to them.

### Improve Other People's Games
This sounds a bit rude, but if we look at gamejams, there's teams who can't get everything they aim for done in the short time period the gamejam runs for. There's probably some aspect of the game that can be improved. So, for example, if you're interested in game sound then find a game that doesn't have the best sound and do your own sound design for it. Send it to them and if they like what they see (or hear), then there's a chance they'll contact you if they need sound design for a future game. Works also for concept art, game concept prototypes (e.g, an improvement on their Spiderman inspired web-swinging mechanic), and other areas.

This is also a great way to build your portfolio. You don't need whole game in your portfolio. Include concepts too or even things like your optimisation report. Make things look organised, high-quality, and professional and that's how you'll be perceived.

(Also a great way to make contacts)<br>

### Join the USW Start-up Stiwdio
There's branches in Treforest, Newport, and Cardiff. They offer a lot of free business advice if you want to be self-employed and make games, like marketing, managing business accounts, funding support, and access to contacts. It's free for USW graduates and I've met a few groups of friends setting up indie studios together there.

There are even some highly established game developers at some of these...

### How to Sell on Steam
Steam takes a good chunk of your revenue, but for many it is worth it to even be able to have a platform to sell their games and be found. It's a good place to be a developer IMO.
